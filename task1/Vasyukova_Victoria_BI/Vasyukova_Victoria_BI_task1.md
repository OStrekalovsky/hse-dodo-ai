## Solutions in cooking
### LEVEL oven by Markov Corp
Although, it’s build for office spaces, AI-powered oven can become the smartest tool in any kitchen, heating multiple items of food to different temperatures at the same time. Inside Level is an advanced closed loop temperature control system that uses both visual and thermal cameras to enable precision cooking, providing real-time data to monitor cooking progress and letting user know exactly when food is done.

### Little Caesars 
In 2018 Little Caesars issued a patent for “apparatus provided for assembling pizza,” which includes “a pizza sauce spreading station, a cheese spreading station and a pepperoni applying station.” The robot will have an articulating arm with a gripper attached to grab onto pizzas, as well as a rotary dial system to ensure proper cheese and pepperoni distribution.
There already is Zume Pizza in Silicon Valley which uses robots to stretch pizza dough, add sauce, and put everything into the oven. However they still needed humans to add the toppings because toppings come in different weights, sizes, and textures — something that Little Caesar’s robot is able to do on its own.

## Management 
### Presto A.I. (previously known as E la Carte)
Smart dining system that can predict customer’s preferences (collecting 10 times more customer feedback), table turn count, daily average check size and labour requirements for each shift. Already used by Denny’s, Applebee’s International, Outback Steakhouse and many others.

### Winnow Vision
Managing food waste with Winnow Vision is super simple. It is already used in big companies like IKEA in its Bistro and Restaurant (IKEA case: https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/650776/assets/videos/IKEA-and-Winnow-building-the-kitchen-of-the-future.mp4). Using computer vision, after a period of training, Winnow Vision automatically recognizes the wasted food items from camera shot, determines its quantity and price. Wasted items are automatically recorded taking zero staff time and completely eliminating human error. Teams benefit from powerful reporting which drives down waste and cuts food costs.

## And hiring
Recently McDonald’s partnered with Textio to modernize their recruiting process, making it faster and reaching top-quality applicants in an inclusive manner, also making their new gender balance and diversity strategy come true. 
Textio is based on belief that language determines your result when trying to get a job. It is the augmented writing platform. The first product, Textio Hire, works by analyzing the real outcomes of more than 350M job posts and recruiting messages. This way Textio predicts the performance of a potential candidate. 
## New ways of making an order
### CaliBurger
AI-enabled self-ordering kiosks with facial recognition software to identify registered customers and pull up their loyalty accounts and order preferences. Launched in Pasadena in 2017 with NEC, multinational IT company in the US. In 2018 the platform allowed customers to pay using their faces. CaliBurger aims to roll out the AI-powered face payment technology to additional locations in Seattle and then in the Maryland and Washington D.C. area. Currently, CaliBurger has 40 locations. The plan is to enable the technology all across the globe in the next 12 months.

Similar to Cali’s self-order kiosks by Xenial (via a recent acquisition of NEXTEP SYSTEMS) don’t put personal information at risk because they don't store images of guests' faces. Instead, guest facial geometry is stored only for the purpose of looking up previous orders. (This data is not tied to credit cards or other personal information and can only be captured once guests have given their consent to opt-in.)

### Voice-based conversational AI agents
-	**Apprente, Inc.** 
-	**Voix**
Voix converts existing phone line into an AI-powered voice assistant to allow restaurants to take order, book table or offer specials to the customer, in turn, saving $1000s in employee salaries, training, and other human errors. With a team of serial entrepreneurs and technologists, Voix is on the mission to disrupt $72b+ phone food ordering industry.

-	**SYNQ3 Restaurant Solutions, formerly Stellar Restaurant Solutions**
VIA (Virtual Intelligent Assistant) is powered by Interactions patented, and incredibly advanced, Adaptive Understanding technology; which blends Artificial Intelligence and human understanding to deliver a superior restaurant ordering technology with enhanced capabilities. These technologies enable restaurant operators to provide a highly conversational and engaging ordering interface. The beauty of the technology is in its ability to pick up most all types of speech and sounds. It can tell a person’s level of interaction based on their response times and murmurs. It can even tell if someone is crying or laughing. Basically, VIA incorporates incredibly advanced, speech-recognition technology that requires very little human interpretation, which improves the order automation process and keeps costs down.

-	**Valyant AI**
A Colorado-based artificial intelligence (AI) company focused on customer service in the quick-serve restaurant industry, in 2019 announced the launch of its conversational AI customer service platform. It is currently taking live customer breakfast orders at the drive thru at Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard. To ensure accuracy, the Valyant AI system employs human-in-the-loop (a model that requires human interaction) on all orders. This allows guaranteed order accuracy, problem identification and catching opportunities for improving the experience.

-	**Domino’s**
Domino’s revealed in April, 2018 that it’s launching a voice recognition application to take telephone orders coming into its stores. The pizza chain, which conducts more than 65 percent of its U.S. sales via digital platforms, was the first to introduce a voice recognition app that conducted a retail transaction when it launched its virtual ordering assistant, DOM, in 2014.

## Handling orders (delivery and waiters’ performance)
### Pizza Hut
In May 2016, MailOnline reported that Pizza Hut is trialling Pepper the robot who greets customers and takes orders. In 2018 company announced that Bear Robotic’s robot called ‘Penny’ will be serving plates in Seoul. Penny is autonomous, it can take food directly from the kitchen to a programmed table in the dining room. Weight sensors determine when customers takes their plates from Penny, so it can move onto the next task. It’s AI-driven, avoiding people and other obstacles and controlled by user-friendly app for managers. They can simply mark key locations (Table 1, kitchen, etc.) and the robot will learn the layout by moving around the space, drawing a map as it goes.

## And also
TOMRA’S Food Sorting Technology and KanKan were mentioned by everyone, I guess (as well as other technologies presented here https://foodindustryexecutive.com/2018/04/6-examples-of-artificial-intelligence-in-the-food-industry/).
